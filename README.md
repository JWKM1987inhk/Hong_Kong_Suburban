# Hong_Kong_Suburban
A website devoted to exploring Hong Kong through its wonderful metro system, the MTR.

This is my first website project, so I'm happy to take any pull requests to improve the site or make it more efficient. 

The fully-responsive site was built from scratch using Bootstrap 3. The main page (index.html), css file, and JS file are available.
